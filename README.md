# Ant-Colony-System-Framework
An implementation of Ant Colony System in Java

An *Ant Colony System* consists of a set of cooperating agents, called ants, that cooperate to find a good solution for optimization problems on graphs similar to the Travel Salesman Problem. (see *Dorigo, M., Gambardella, L.M., “Ant Colony System: A Cooperative Learning Approach to the Travel Salesman Problem”, TR/IRIDIA/1996-5, Université Libre de Bruxelle*)
Each single ant reflects a very trivial behavior: it simply goes from a node to another across an arc, but when all ants cooperate, like actual ants do in a real colony, the whole system reveals an intelligent behavior, as much as it is able to find a good solution for the TSP.
